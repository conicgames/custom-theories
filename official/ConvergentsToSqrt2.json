    "default": "Use the convergents to √2 to increase ρ. The first few convergents to √2 are as follows: 1, 3/2, 7/5, 17/12. N_n is the numerator of the nth convergent to √2 and D_n is the nth denominator, with 0th convergent being 1/1. In the limit, these converge to √2. The convergents oscillate above and below √2. The rate of change of q is based on the precision of the approximation."
