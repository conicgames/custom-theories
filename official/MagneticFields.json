    "default": "A Custom Theory to explore the basic concepts of Magnetic Fields.\nDiscover the equations that describe the movement of a charged particle inside a solenoid of infinite length.\nWatch how rho grows as the particle moves away from its starting position and the magnetic field becomes stronger.\nReset the particle's position to update its velocity to increase your long-term benefits.\nHave fun!\n"
